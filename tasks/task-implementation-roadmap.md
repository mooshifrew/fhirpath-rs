## Current Achievements
âœ… **Completed Successfully:**
- Basic arithmetic operators (*, /, mod)
- Mathematical functions (abs, ceiling, floor, sqrt, etc.)
- String contains function (90.9% success)
- Type conversion functions (toString 100%, toInteger 100%)

## Next Recommended Steps
1. **Finish Task 6c** - Complete toDecimal() function (quick win)
2. **Start Task 8** - String functions (highest impact)
3. **Continue Task 7** - Collection functions (high value)

This roadmap provides a strategic path to achieve **67%+ test coverage** with systematic implementation of remaining FHIRPath features.
