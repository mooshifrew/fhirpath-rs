# FHIRPath Performance Optimization Tasks

This directory contains detailed microtasks for implementing the performance optimizations outlined in ADR-006. The tasks are organized into phases that build upon each other.

## Overview

The performance optimization is divided into 4 main phases plus supporting infrastructure:

### Phase 1: Parser Optimizations (Weeks 1-2)
**Target**: 15-30% parser performance improvement

- **File**: [`phase1-parser-optimizations.md`](./phase1-parser-optimizations.md)
- **Focus**: Token matching, memory layout, error path optimization
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Replace `std::mem::discriminant()` with direct pattern matching
  - Implement const lookup tables for operator precedence  
  - Add token interning for frequently used identifiers
  - Optimize memory layout with `repr(u8)` and boxing
  - Pre-allocate common error messages

### Phase 2: Evaluator Core Optimizations (Weeks 3-5)
**Target**: 40-60% evaluator performance improvement

- **File**: [`phase2-evaluator-core-optimizations.md`](./phase2-evaluator-core-optimizations.md)
- **Focus**: Value system redesign, context management, function calls
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Implement copy-on-write for `FhirPathValue`
  - Add `ValueRef` with `Cow` semantics
  - Context pooling and stack allocation
  - Pre-compile function signatures
  - Specialized evaluators by expression complexity

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Weeks 6-8)
**Target**: 30-50% additional performance improvement

- **File**: [`phase3-advanced-optimizations.md`](./phase3-advanced-optimizations.md)
- **Focus**: Bytecode compilation, memory management, algorithmic improvements
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Design and implement bytecode instruction set
  - Custom arena allocator for temporary values
  - Lazy evaluation for collection operations
  - Streaming evaluation for large datasets
  - SIMD optimizations for numeric operations

### Phase 4: Specialization and Caching (Weeks 9-10)
**Target**: 20-40% additional performance improvement

- **File**: [`phase4-specialization-caching.md`](./phase4-specialization-caching.md)
- **Focus**: Pattern recognition, result caching, hot path optimization
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Expression pattern recognition and specialized evaluators
  - LRU cache for expression results
  - Function memoization for pure functions
  - Profile-guided optimization
  - Performance telemetry integration

### Infrastructure and Validation (Parallel to all phases)
**Target**: Support optimization with robust testing and monitoring

- **File**: [`infrastructure-and-validation.md`](./infrastructure-and-validation.md)
- **Focus**: Testing, monitoring, documentation
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Enhanced benchmark suite with memory tracking
  - Stress testing and property-based testing
  - Performance monitoring framework
  - Real-time performance dashboard
  - Comprehensive documentation

## Task Organization

Each task file contains:

- **Goal and Timeline**: Clear objectives and time estimates
- **Detailed Tasks**: Broken down into implementable units
- **Implementation Examples**: Code snippets showing approach
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success metrics
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and related tasks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Strategies to minimize implementation risks

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Phase**: Start with infrastructure tasks to establish benchmarking
2. **Phase 1**: Begin with parser optimizations (foundational)
3. **Phase 2**: Move to evaluator optimizations (biggest impact)
4. **Phase 3**: Add advanced optimizations (significant gains)
5. **Phase 4**: Implement specialization and caching (final polish)

## Task Status Tracking

Each task should be updated with status as work progresses:

- **Pending**: Not yet started
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Blocked**: Waiting for dependencies
- **Review**: Ready for code review
- **Testing**: In testing phase
- **Complete**: Finished and validated

## Success Metrics Summary

### Performance Targets
- **Parser**: 1.4-6M ops/sec → 2-8M ops/sec (25-35% improvement)
- **Evaluator**: 7-9K ops/sec → 15-30K ops/sec (100-250% improvement)
- **Memory**: 30-50% reduction in allocations
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond evaluation for simple expressions

### Quality Metrics
- **Compatibility**: 100% FHIRPath specification compliance maintained
- **Testing**: All existing tests pass throughout optimization
- **Safety**: Memory safety preserved (minimal unsafe code)
- **Regression**: Automated performance regression detection

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow Rust performance best practices
- Maintain extensive test coverage
- Document all optimizations thoroughly
- Use feature flags for experimental optimizations

### Testing Strategy
- Run benchmarks before and after each optimization
- Validate correctness with official FHIRPath test suite
- Use property-based testing for edge cases
- Implement stress testing for production scenarios

### Risk Management
- Implement changes incrementally
- Maintain fallback mechanisms
- Monitor for performance regressions
- Document all architectural decisions
