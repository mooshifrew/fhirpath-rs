# Phase 2 Task 07: Set Operations

**Task ID**: phase2-07  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ TODO  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days  
**Dependencies**: phase1-05 (Collection Operations Polish)  

## Overview

Implement and complete set operations that are currently partially implemented or missing. This includes essential set theory operations like union, intersection, and set comparison functions that are fundamental to collection manipulation in FHIRPath.

## Current Status

| Test Suite | Current Pass Rate | Tests | Category |
|------------|------------------|-------|----------|
| combine.json | 33.3% (1/3) | 3 | Partially Implemented |
| sub-set-of.json | 0.0% (0/3) | 3 | Missing |
| super-set-of.json | 0.0% (0/2) | 2 | Missing |
| intersect.json | 100% (4/4) | 4 | Fully Passing |
| exclude.json | 100% (4/4) | 4 | Fully Passing |

**Total Impact**: 16 tests, currently ~50% average passing  
**Expected Coverage Increase**: ~1.2% of total test suite  
**Strategic Importance**: Essential for collection set theory operations

## Problem Analysis

Set operations require implementing:
1. **Union operations** - Complete `combine()` function implementation
2. **Subset testing** - `subsetOf()` function for set containment
3. **Superset testing** - `supersetOf()` function for set containment
4. **Set comparison** - Proper set equality and containment logic
5. **Duplicate handling** - Proper handling of duplicates in set operations

## Implementation Tasks

### 2. Subset/Superset Operations (Days 2-3)
- [ ] Implement `subsetOf()` function (3 tests)
- [ ] Add `supersetOf()` function (2 tests)
- [ ] Handle empty set edge cases
- [ ] Implement proper set containment logic
- [ ] Add type-aware set comparison

### 3. Integration and Testing (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Integrate with existing collection operations
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

2. Add supersetOf function
3. Handle edge cases and empty sets
4. Test against subset/superset suites

### Phase 3: Integration (Days 3-4)
1. Integrate with collection operations
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Optimize for performance
4. Final testing and validation

## Files to Modify

### Core Implementation
- `fhirpath-evaluator/src/engine.rs` - Set operation evaluation
- `fhirpath-evaluator/src/functions/set.rs` - Set operation functions
- `fhirpath-model/src/value.rs` - Set comparison operations

### Testing
- Add comprehensive set operation tests
- Update integration tests
- Add performance benchmarks

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each set operation individually
- Test with various data types
- Test empty set handling
- Test duplicate handling
- Test performance with large sets

### Integration Tests
- Run set operation test suites continuously
- Test complex set expressions
- Verify no regressions in other areas

### Validation
- Run `./scripts/update-test-coverage.sh` after completion
- Verify coverage increase from current level
- Test with various collection scenarios

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: Increase overall test coverage by ~1.2%
- **Secondary**: All 16 set operation tests passing
- **Performance**: Efficient set operations for large collections
- **Quality**: Mathematically correct set theory implementation

## Technical Considerations

### Set Union Implementation
- Proper duplicate removal
- Maintain original order when possible
- Efficient algorithms for large collections
- Type-aware equality comparison

### Set Containment Logic
- Proper subset/superset testing
- Handle empty set edge cases
- Efficient containment checking
- Support for all data types

### Performance Optimization
- Use efficient data structures (HashSet for lookups)
- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Optimize for common use cases
- Consider streaming operations for large sets

## Risks and Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Performance with large sets**: Use efficient algorithms, profile operations
- **Type comparison complexity**: Follow FHIRPath specification strictly

### Medium Risk
- **Memory usage**: Optimize set handling, avoid unnecessary copies
- **Edge case handling**: Test thoroughly with various inputs

### Low Risk
- **Basic set operations**: Well-understood mathematical operations

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies
- **phase1-05**: Collection Operations Polish must be complete
- **Set theory foundation**: Requires stable collection handling

### Enables Future Tasks
- **Advanced collection operations**: Set operations enable complex data manipulation
- **Query optimization**: Efficient set operations improve query performance
- **Data analysis**: Foundation for advanced data analysis operations

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Update task status to ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED
2. Run comprehensive test coverage report
3. Update phase progress in task index
4. Complete Phase 2 (all 7 tasks done)
5. Begin Phase 3 with phase3-02 (Quantity Handling Implementation)
