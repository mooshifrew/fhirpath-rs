# FHIRPath-RS Development Roadmap

Generated on: 2025-07-27
Last Updated: 2025-07-27 23:40
Current Status: 32.2% test coverage (324/1005 tests passing)

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the development phases needed to bring fhirpath-rs from its current 32.2% test coverage to full FHIRPath specification compliance and optimize performance for LSP usage.

**Current Implementation Analysis:**
- ✅ **18 test suites** (100% passing) - Strong foundation established
- 🟡 **4 test suites** (70%+ passing) - Well implemented, minor fixes needed  
- 🟠 **32 test suites** (30-70% passing) - Partial implementation, completion needed
- 🔴 **23 test suites** (<30% passing) - Major issues requiring significant work
- ❌ **21 test suites** (0% passing) - Completely missing functionality

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Consolidation (Priority: HIGH)
**Goal**: Complete and stabilize partially implemented core functionality
**Current Status**: 32 test suites with 30-70% pass rates need completion
**Impact**: Will increase coverage to ~55-60%
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks

**Key Areas:**
- Comparison operators (equality, greater-than, less-than families)
- String functions (contains, starts-with, ends-with)
- Math operations (plus, minus, divide edge cases)
- Type conversion functions (to-integer, to-decimal)

### Phase 2: Critical Missing Functions (Priority: HIGH)
**Goal**: Implement completely missing core FHIRPath functionality
**Current Status**: 21 test suites with 0% implementation
**Impact**: Will increase coverage to ~75-80%
**Timeline**: 5-6 weeks

**Key Areas:**
- Type system (type.json, types.json - 129 tests total)
- Variable definitions (define-variable.json - 21 tests)
- Collection operations (indexer.json, repeat.json)
- Date/time functions (now.json, period.json)
- String manipulation (split.json, to-string.json, to-chars.json)

### Phase 3: Major Issue Resolution (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Goal**: Fix significant problems in low-performing areas
**Current Status**: 23 test suites with <30% pass rates
**Impact**: Will increase coverage to ~85-90%
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

**Key Areas:**
- Literals parsing (literals.json - 82 tests, only 22% passing)
- Quantity handling (quantity.json - 11 tests, only 18% passing)
- Advanced string functions (matches.json, replace-matches.json)
- Mathematical functions (power.json, log.json, precision.json)

### Phase 4: Polish and Edge Cases (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Goal**: Perfect well-implemented functions and handle edge cases
**Current Status**: 4 test suites with 70%+ pass rates need final touches
**Impact**: Will increase coverage to ~92-95%
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

**Key Areas:**
- Collection contains operations
- Division and modulo edge cases
- String concatenation edge cases

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization (Priority: LOW)
**Goal**: Optimize for LSP performance requirements
**Current Status**: Basic functionality complete, optimization needed
**Impact**: Sub-millisecond parsing for typical expressions
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)
**Goal**: Implement advanced FHIRPath features and extensions
**Current Status**: Core functionality complete
**Impact**: 98%+ test coverage with advanced features
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1**: Test coverage increases to 55-60%
- **Phase 2**: Test coverage increases to 75-80%
- **Phase 3**: Test coverage increases to 85-90%
- **Phase 4**: Test coverage increases to 92-95%
- **Phase 5**: Sub-millisecond parsing for typical expressions
- **Phase 6**: 98%+ test coverage with advanced features

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Parser foundation issues could cascade
- **Medium Risk**: Complex function interdependencies
- **Low Risk**: Performance optimizations are incremental

## Resource Requirements

- **Development Time**: 12-18 weeks total
- **Testing**: Continuous integration with official test suites
- **Documentation**: ADRs for major architectural decisions
