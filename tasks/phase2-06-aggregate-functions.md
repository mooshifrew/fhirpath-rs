# Phase 2 Task 06: Aggregate Functions

**Task ID**: phase2-06  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ TODO  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days  
**Dependencies**: phase1-05 (Collection Operations Polish)  

## Overview

Implement aggregate functions that are currently 0% implemented. This includes essential collection aggregation functions that are fundamental to data analysis and reporting in FHIRPath expressions.

## Current Status

| Test Suite | Current Pass Rate | Tests | Category |
|------------|------------------|-------|----------|
| aggregate.json | 0.0% (0/4) | 4 | Missing |

**Total Impact**: 4 tests, currently 0% passing  
**Expected Coverage Increase**: ~0.4% of total test suite  
**Strategic Importance**: Essential for data analysis and collection processing

## Problem Analysis

Aggregate functions require implementing:
1. **Sum aggregation** - `sum()` function for numeric collections
2. **Average calculation** - `avg()` function for numeric collections  
3. **Min/Max functions** - `min()` and `max()` functions
4. **Count aggregation** - Enhanced `count()` with conditions
5. **Type handling** - Proper handling of different numeric types

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Basic Aggregate Functions (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Implement `sum()` function for numeric collections
- [ ] Add `avg()` function with proper precision handling
- [ ] Implement `min()` and `max()` functions
- [ ] Handle empty collection cases
- [ ] Add type coercion for mixed numeric types

### 2. Advanced Aggregation (Days 2-3)
- [ ] Enhance `count()` function with conditional counting
- [ ] Add support for quantity aggregation with units
- [ ] Implement proper null/empty value handling
- [ ] Add aggregation with grouping if required
- [ ] Handle overflow and precision issues

### 3. Integration and Testing (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Integrate with collection operations
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement proper type checking
- [ ] Add performance optimizations
- [ ] Final testing and validation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Ensure memory efficiency

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Functions (Days 1-2)
1. Analyze aggregate test requirements
2. Implement sum, avg, min, max functions
3. Handle basic numeric type coercion
4. Test against aggregate test suite

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Days 2-3)
1. Add conditional counting support
2. Implement quantity aggregation
3. Handle edge cases and null values
4. Add precision and overflow handling

### Phase 3: Integration (Days 3-4)
1. Integrate with collection operations
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Optimize for performance
4. Final testing and validation

## Files to Modify

### Core Implementation
- `fhirpath-evaluator/src/engine.rs` - Aggregate function evaluation
- `fhirpath-evaluator/src/functions/aggregate.rs` - New aggregate functions module
- `fhirpath-model/src/value.rs` - Numeric aggregation operations

### Testing
- Add comprehensive aggregate function tests
- Update integration tests
- Add performance benchmarks

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each aggregate function individually
- Test with various numeric types
- Test empty collection handling
- Test overflow and precision cases
- Test quantity aggregation

### Integration Tests
- Run aggregate test suite continuously
- Test with large collections
- Verify no regressions in other areas

### Validation
- Run `./scripts/update-test-coverage.sh` after completion
- Verify coverage increase from current level
- Test performance with large datasets

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: Increase overall test coverage by ~0.4%
- **Secondary**: All 4 aggregate tests passing
- **Performance**: Efficient aggregation for large collections
- **Quality**: Accurate numeric calculations with proper precision

## Technical Considerations

### Numeric Precision Handling
- Use appropriate decimal types for precision
- Handle integer overflow gracefully
- Maintain precision in average calculations
- Support for different numeric types

### Collection Processing
- Efficient iteration over large collections
- Memory-efficient aggregation algorithms
- Support for streaming aggregation if needed
- Proper handling of empty collections

### Type Coercion
- Consistent type coercion rules across functions
- Integration with existing type system
- Proper handling of mixed type collections
- Error handling for incompatible types

## Risks and Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Numeric precision**: Use appropriate decimal types, test edge cases
- **Performance with large collections**: Use efficient algorithms, profile operations

### Medium Risk
- **Type coercion complexity**: Follow FHIRPath specification strictly
- **Overflow handling**: Test with extreme values

### Low Risk
- **Basic aggregation**: Well-understood mathematical operations

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies
- **phase1-05**: Collection Operations Polish must be complete
- **Numeric types**: Requires stable numeric type handling

### Enables Future Tasks
- **Data analysis**: Foundation for complex data analysis operations
- **Reporting**: Essential for generating reports and summaries
- **Advanced queries**: Enables sophisticated data queries

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Update task status to ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED
2. Run comprehensive test coverage report
3. Update phase progress in task index
4. Begin phase2-07 (Set Operations)
5. Validate aggregate functions work with real data
